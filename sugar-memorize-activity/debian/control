Description: Sugar Learning Platform - memorize activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Memorize is a game where the user discover pairs of matching tiles.
 The pairs can consist of any multimedia object. While there are predefined
 games to play, Memorize allows create new games. Sugar collaboration
 allows play to two users through a network.
